# HeyMarvin feature inventory and gap analysis

Researched 2026-10-15 from heymarvin.com (product, pricing, integrations pages), the Marvin help centre, the 2024 recap, the Fall '25 and Summer 2026 release posts, and G2/TrustRadius for third-party context. Marketing claims were cross-checked against help-centre articles where one existed; where only marketing copy exists, the row says so. Nothing below is invented: if the research did not show a capability, it is marked "not confirmed".

## How to read the status column

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Built** | Exists in this repository today and is verified by tests or manual checks |
| **Partial** | Some of it exists; the gap column says what is missing |
| **Not built** | In scope for this product eventually, nothing exists yet |
| **Spec: v2 / Later** | Spec v0.1 explicitly scheduled it for v2 or "Later" |
| **Spec: out of scope** | Spec v0.1 explicitly excluded it (in-app transcription, surveys, recruiting, billing, AI in v1) |
| **Not confirmed** | Marvin may have it, but the research could not confirm the details |

## Marvin in one paragraph

Marvin (formerly HeyMarvin) sells itself as an "AI-native customer insights platform" with four pillars: a **Knowledge Hub** (the repository: files, notes, tags, search, Ask AI), **Research Methods** (an AI notetaker that joins calls, AI-moderated interviews in 40+ languages, the new Live Intercept widget), an **Analysis Studio** (auto-tagging against a global taxonomy, thematic and sentiment analysis, affinity mapping, survey charts, "Deep Research" templates) and **Reporting & Insights** (an insight report editor, clips, playlists and highlight reels, Slack and email digests, Salesforce, an MCP server for Claude/ChatGPT/Copilot). It is priced per seat on Free, Starter, Pro and Enterprise plans with Full, Collaborator and Viewer seat types; the official page lists no prices, and third-party figures disagree ($49 to $99 per month on one listing, $3,000 to $6,000 per year with a five-seat minimum on another). Compliance is a selling point: SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 42001, GDPR, HIPAA with a BAA, EU or US data residency.

The repository in this folder was built to spec v0.1, which deliberately covers only the core of the Knowledge Hub: projects, participants, transcript and recording upload, highlighting and tagging, search. Everything AI, every integration, and anything to do with running studies was out of scope or deferred. The gap below is therefore large by design; the useful question is which non-AI pieces the team will miss first.

## Feature inventory and gap

### 1. Capture and ingestion

| Feature | What Marvin does | Ours | Status | Gap / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Meeting notetaker | A bot joins Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams calls from the calendar, records, transcribes and takes automatic notes; can be invited by email to calendar events (help: Set up integrations; Fall '25) | None | Spec: Later ("Zoom or Teams import") | Spec wants file import from those tools, not a bot |
| In-app and phone recording | Record in-person meetings and phone calls inside Marvin and transcribe them (2024 recap; help: What kinds of data) | None | Spec: out of scope (transcription) | |
| Automatic transcription | Every recording is transcribed; transcripts can be translated into 35 languages (help: Annotation tool) | We import VTT, SRT, DOCX and Dovetail markdown produced elsewhere | Spec: out of scope | Self-hosted Whisper would be the obvious route if the exclusion is reversed |
| File uploads | Audio, video, Word and Google Docs, Excel and Sheets, PowerPoint, PDF, TXT, images (JPG/PNG); Import API accepts up to 10 GB of media and 500 MB of documents per transfer (help: Upload files; Import API) | VTT, SRT, DOCX, MD, TXT transcripts; MP4, M4A, MP3 recordings, streamed to disk with configurable limits | Partial | No PDF, PPT, XLSX, images, WAV, MOV; no "note" files other than markdown |

| Survey import | Qualtrics, Pendo, SurveyMonkey, Google Forms, Microsoft Forms (refreshed twice daily), Dscout, CSV; responses become charts and NPS (help: What kinds of data; Fall '25) | None | Spec: out of scope (surveys) | |
| Support tickets and sales calls | Zendesk, Intercom tickets in bulk; Gong call sync with participants added to the panel (2024 recap) | None | Not built | Pro plan only in Marvin |
| Usability platforms | UserTesting, Maze, Dscout imports for mixed-media analysis (help: What kinds of data) | None | Not built | |
| Dovetail import | Imports Dovetail projects, notes and tag hierarchy (needs Collaborator access); not video, audio, rich text in insights or CSV surveys (help: Import from Dovetail) | Importer for a Dovetail export mirror (projects, files, highlights, tags, participants), idempotent by external id | Partial | Ours reads an offline mirror rather than the Dovetail API; no insight import |
| Import API | Continuous sync of audio, video, text, CSV, PDF and Office files from any system (Summer 2026) | None | Not built | |
| Trim recording | Trim start and end of a recording; transcript, highlights, notes, summaries and search update; original not kept (help: Annotation tool) | None | Not built | Our anchors would survive a trim only if segment times are shifted, not text |

### 2. Transcript and annotation tool

| Feature | What Marvin does | Ours | Status | Gap / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Edit transcript text | Click a word and type over it (help: Annotation tool) | Inline editing in the TipTap editor; highlights keep their anchors (segment + offset) through edits | Built | Ours additionally guarantees highlights elsewhere never shift (decisions D5, D6, D19) |
| Search inside a transcript | Keyword search showing every instance (help: Annotation tool) | None in the editor; repository search finds the line and deep-links to it | Not built | Small: a find bar over segment text |
| Find and replace | Fix a misspelt word once or everywhere (help: Annotation tool) | None | Not built | Small; must go through `saveSegment` per segment to keep anchors |
| Speakers | Assign, swap, unassign and add speakers; speaker identification on transcription (help: Annotation tool) | Rename one line or all lines by a speaker, link a speaker to a participant | Built | No "add a speaker to part of a segment" (would need a split, excluded in v1) |
| Listen to one speaker | Play only one speaker's portions (help: Annotation tool) | None | Not built | Medium: needs segment-time playlist in the player |
| Playback sync | Transcript follows the video; notes link to timestamps (marketing; help: Clips) | Click a line to seek; the playing line is marked; duration captured from the browser | Built | Spec listed this under v2; it shipped early |
| Download transcript | Download as .docx; translate into 35 languages (help: Annotation tool) | Download of the original uploaded file only | Partial | Export of the edited transcript (docx/vtt/txt) is not built; translation is AI, out of scope |
| File metadata | Change the file date; add file tags; "Mark as annotated" (help: Annotation tool) | Source date and participants editable | Partial | No file-level tags, no reviewed flag |
| Hide personal information | Redact sensitive participant details; speaker anonymisation with a preserve list; face blur (Enterprise; Summer 2026) | None | Not built | Spec open question about participant data was answered "admin deletes"; redaction never discussed |
| Summaries | AI summary per file, editable and regenerable, role-tuned, shareable to Slack (help: Annotation tool) | None | Spec: out of scope (AI) | |

### 3. Notes, highlights and clips

| Feature | What Marvin does | Ours | Status | Gap / notes |

| Merge overlapping labels | Merge from the Labels page (help: Tagging) | Merge keeps every highlight tagged once, moves Dovetail ids (D29) | Built | |
| Archive | Advised in content; a dedicated archive feature was not confirmed | Archive and restore, hidden from pickers, still filterable | Built | We may exceed Marvin here |
| File-level tags | Tags on whole files, separate from content labels (help: File tags) | None | Not built | Small: `SourceTag` table and picker on the source page |
| AI auto-tagging | Every incoming source is tagged against the global taxonomy; "AI-powered Tagging" matches the existing taxonomy (marketing; Fall '25) | None | Spec: out of scope (AI) | The most-cited Marvin time saver ("68% reduction in analysis time") |
| Tag graphs and AND filters | Graphs grouped by label or question; filters combine labels with AND (help: Tagging) | Search supports ANY/ALL tag filters; no charts | Partial | Tag frequency counts per project would be cheap |

## Scorecard

Counting the rows above (Marvin features, not the spec's acceptance criteria):

Read it this way: about a third of Marvin's surface is AI or study-running that the spec excluded; the repository core the spec asked for is built; the real distance to "a Marvin replacement" is the middle column plus insights, clips, sharing and integrations.

## Where this repository is ahead of, or different from, Marvin

- **Highlights survive editing by construction.** Anchors are segment id plus character offset, segments cannot be split or merged, and a highlight whose words are deleted is kept as "orphaned" (decisions D5, D6, D19). Marvin's help notes that trimming updates highlights, but documents no guarantee for text edits.
- **Tag archive, merge with id history, and case-insensitive uniqueness** are implemented; Marvin's archive could not be confirmed.
- **Saved, shareable filter views** exist as first-class objects; Marvin's equivalent is topic subscriptions.
- **Self-hosted, no seat pricing, EU data by default**, which was the reason for the project.
- **Synthetic seed data in the Dovetail mirror shape**, so the real export can be imported later with the same code.

## Suggested next steps

Ordered by what the team would feel first. Sizes are rough: S under a day, M a few days, L a week or more. Nothing here is committed.

**A. Finish spec v2 as written**
1. Insights: statement, description, confidence, product area, linked highlights from any project; browse by tag and product area; open a highlight at its moment. (M)
2. Clips: play a highlight from its start to end time in the player; cut MP4/MP3 clips with ffmpeg on the server; download link. (M)
3. Playlists of clips, minimal: ordered list, play through. (S after clips)

**B. Non-AI parity that costs little**
4. Note text on highlights in the side panel (column and action already exist). (S)
5. Find and find-and-replace inside a transcript, routed through per-segment saves. (S)
6. Tag frequency counts per project and a cross-project tag × project matrix. (S)
7. Custom participant columns (typed definitions plus JSON values) and CSV import/export. (M)
8. File-level tags on sources, and project-scoped tags with a template to copy a set. (M)
9. Comments on highlights and insights with mentions. (M)
10. Share-by-link for a source, highlight or insight with a signed token and an admin setting for link modes. (M)
11. Admin settings page: who can see participants, who can create tags, link modes, viewer search restriction. (S–M)
12. Project export (JSON plus files) and per-source edited-transcript export (docx, vtt, txt). (S)
13. A table view of highlights with tag columns, sortable and filterable. (S)

**C. Ingestion**
14. Import of Zoom and Teams recording folders and their VTT transcripts (spec "Later"). (M)
15. PDF, PPTX, XLSX and image files as "note" sources with text extraction where possible. (M)
16. In-app transcription with a self-hosted Whisper service. Reverses a spec exclusion; needs Bruno's decision. (L)
17. Confluence or Notion export of insights (spec "Later"). (M)

**D. AI tier, only if the team asks (spec)**
18. Auto-tagging new sources against the global taxonomy, with a review queue. (M–L)
19. Per-source summaries and per-highlight suggestions. (M)
20. Ask-the-repository with citations to highlight and timestamp, built on the existing full-text search as the retriever. (L)
21. Thematic clustering across highlights. (L)
22. An MCP server exposing search and highlights to Claude, which is small once the API exists and is Marvin's current headline. (S–M)
